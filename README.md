# Security-System

This is an Open source Face detection security system, using the CV2 Python module to view camera and detect faces.

- I also added the ability to send emails of the picture it took to your email address so you can be notified of someone/somthing entered your room.
- I also added the ability to record footage it sees if theres a face detect, it will record for x(5) amount seconds when it doesn't detect any faces, when those x(5) amount of seconds are over, it stops to record footage.
